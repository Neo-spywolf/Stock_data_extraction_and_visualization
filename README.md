#This project is designed to demonstrate the following key skills and techniques:

-> Data Extraction: We use the yfinance library to extract historical stock price data for Tesla and GameStop. Additionally, we perform web scraping using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract annual revenue data for these companies from publicly available web pages.

-> Data Cleaning: We clean and preprocess the extracted data by removing unnecessary characters, converting data types, and handling missing values. This ensures that the data is in a      suitable format for analysis and visualization.

-> Data Visualization: We employ the matplotlib library to create interactive and informative graphs that visualize the stock price trends and annual revenue for both Tesla and GameStop.    These graphs provide a clear picture of how stock prices and revenue have evolved over time.

-> Time Series Analysis: Through this project, you will gain insights into time series data analysis. We explore how stock prices and annual revenue change over time and analyze any potential patterns or relationships.
